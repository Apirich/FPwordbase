To run the CrossWordle app, open two terminal windows: one for the backend server and one for the frontend application.
1. Backend server: Navigate to the CrossWordleBackend folder, then run the command: node app.js.
2. Frontend application: Navigate to the CrossWordleApp folder, then run the command: npm start. Wait for the QR code to appear.
   
On your mobile device, scan the QR code, and the Expo Go app will automatically load the application. (Ensure the Expo Go app is installed on your device.)

For dependencies, kindly refer to the package.json file in both the CrossWordleBackend and CrossWordleApp folders.

Note: The CrossWordle application was tested using iPhone 8 and iPhone 13 with Expo Go SDK 51.

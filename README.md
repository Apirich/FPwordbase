The project repo is indeed the "CrossWordle51" folder. The other folders are exploratory folders created during different phases:
1. The "wordGame" and "wordLib" folders were used to ensure the ideas were implementable during the design phase.
2. The "CrossWordlePrototypeMidterm" folder was created to implement the feature prototype for the midterm.
3. The "CrossWordle" folder was used before the SDK upgrade from Expo.
4. The "survey" folder stores responses summaries from all user testing surveys.

Note: For instructions on running the application, please refer to the README file located in the CrossWordle51 folder.
